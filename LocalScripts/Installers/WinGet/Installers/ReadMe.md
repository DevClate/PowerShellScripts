## NOTES:

All installs are slent if ran via some form of PS Remoting. When ran locally they are unatennded installs.

--Scope: Script with the "--Scope Machine" will install Machine wide, scripts with "--Scope User" or miss the "--Scope" perimeter are only installed on the profile running the WinGet CMD. Some installs are machine wide though ""--Scope Machine"" was not used, it will be noted in the script and .md of the installer.
